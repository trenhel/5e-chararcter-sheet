# 5e-chararcter-sheet
A character sheet creator project for practicing JavaScript

Only truly tested on Chromium


I need to make this responsive, but as of now the goal was to recreate a character sheet and be able to create a character on that.

There is JS code that needs a real rework, all commented out, that adds saving throw modifiers and fills in the circle next to that modifier.
